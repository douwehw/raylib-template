# Easy and scalable Raylib Template for C(++)

You can use this template to easily develop games in C or C++ using Raylib.

Add your header files to `/src/headers` and add your C/C++ files to `/src` <br> You can add your assets (images, videos, models.. ect) to the `assets` folder.

# How to use

Double click `raylib-template.code-workspace` to instantly open the premade template in Visual Studio Code.

This template uses CMake to compile and run the app, if you do not have a C++ compiler installed already, [I recommend the MSVC compiler](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/).

Also be sure to install the correct VSCode extensions for developing in C++ and CMake.
